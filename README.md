# Employee-Tracker

for this program, when you enter "node server.js" you are met with a user interface, where you're able to view the criteria, department, role, and employee. You're also able to add new departments, roles, and employees. When you finish the function you were on, you are returned to the starting screen. When you click exit, the "application" is closed. You are able to update the role for an employee.  We use sql, so that we are able to connect to the server.


I used past activities to help in the writing of the code. I was having errors I was unable to resolve, so I was unable to post a video for the program. Every time I tried to run the program, I received the error " Error: Unknown database 'employee_tracker'".
